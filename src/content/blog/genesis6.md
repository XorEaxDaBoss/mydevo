## Scripture

  

Genesis 6
  

## Observation

Cain, eldest son of Adam and Eve, becomes jealous of his brother Abel because Abel finds favor in the sight of the Lord and Cain does not.  Rather than heed the Lord's warnings, Cain lets his anger and hatred grow until he takes his brother to a field, committing the first premeditated murder.  Lamech also kills, but he tells his wives that it was in self-defense.

  


## Application

God spoke to Cain and warned him about what was going on in his heart. "If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door.  And its desire is for you, but you should rule over it." (verse 7).  As James explains, "Each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.  Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death." (James 1:14-15).  We are to examine ourselves and see if our desires are in line with God's will, and if they are not, we must rid ourselves of them.  With the Lord's help, we can rule over our sinful desires.



  

## Prayer

Lord, my desire is to serve you, but my sinful nature would have me go totally contrary to that.  Help me, guide me to Your will and not my own, and show me when my desires are in conflict with Yours so that I may turn to You.  In Jesus' name, Amen.
